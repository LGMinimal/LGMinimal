# LGMinimal

<div align="center">

## This language is a "beta" for us to show to the public and see the community's reaction to a new language. Our official project is [LGrow](https://github.com/LGrow)!

</div>

The idea for the project came so we could see how the public would treat a powerful new programming language. LGMinimal was made to be simple. Different from LGrow. We were inspired by Lua, another Brazilian programming language.

Our idea is to be simple, fast and powerful, with power comparable to that of C in a Script language. For this, we need compilation, so that the project becomes fast and efficient.

Our compilation is done quickly and silently, so we can become efficient like C, C++ and Rust.

## Remembering! This is just a test of how the public will deal with a new language! Our official project is [LGrow](https://github.com/LGrow)!
